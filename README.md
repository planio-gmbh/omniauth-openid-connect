The original is [jjbohn/omniauth-openid-connect](https://github.com/jjbohn/omniauth-openid-connect). I gathered the changes that were scattered in many places and integrated them here. In particular, [Shopify/omniauth-identity](https://github.com/Shopify/omniauth-identity), [patatoid/omniauth-openid-reconnect](https://github.com/patatoid/omniauth-openid-reconnect) and [m0n9oose/omniauth_openid_connect](https://github.com/m0n9oose/omniauth_openid_connect). And this package is the successor to the following: 'omniauth-google-oauth2', 'omniauth-yahoojp', 'omniauth-azure-oauth2', 'omniauth-azure-adv2', 'omniauth-line' and 'omniauth-line-openid-connect'.

**Important:** OmniAuth v1.9.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. Application developers need to avoid this vulnerability. See [CVE-2015-9284](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9284), [Resolving CVE 2015 9284 · omniauth/omniauth Wiki](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).



## OpenID Connect

If you use OAuth 2.0 for *authentication* purposes, it will cause a huge security vulnerability. The OAuth 2.0 is a mechanism for *authorization* and does not identify who the access token belongs to. Therefore, there is a risk of token hijacking. Each company has created its countermeasures.

OpenID Connect is a standardized, simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. By using OpenID Connect, we don't need to implement variety extensions of each company.

OpenID Connect uses a mechanism `id_token`. In addition to `access_token`, the authentication server and clients exchange 
the `id_token`, and verifying the signature and nonce makes preventing spoofing.

There is no technical continuity with OpenID 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Only names are similar.
For more information on OpenID Connect, see [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

<s>(2017-09) As of now, Azure AD doesn't meet the OpenID Connect specification. You must set `true` of  `:send_client_secret_to_token_endpoint` option.</s> (2020.6) OmniAuth::OpenIDConnect v0.8 has configured automatically for Azure AD. Simply set the option `discovery:true`.

### Additional Configuration Notes

  * `name` is arbitrary, I recommend using the name of your provider. The name
  configuration exists because you could be using multiple OpenID Connect
  providers in a single app.

  **NOTE**: if you use this gem with Devise you should use `:openid_connect` name,
  or Devise would route to 'users/auth/:provider' rather than 'users/auth/openid_connect'

  * `response_type` tells the authorization server which grant type the application wants to use,
  currently, only `'code'` (Authorization Code grant) and `['id_token', 'token']` (Implicit grant) are valid.
  Do not use `id_token`. This is valid only under Self-Issued OpenID Providers.

  * If you want to pass `state` paramete by yourself. You can set Proc Object.
  e.g. `state: Proc.new { SecureRandom.hex(32) }`

  * ON Authorization Code Flow, `nonce` is optional. If you don't want to pass the "nonce" parameter to provider, you should specify
  `false` to `send_nonce` option (default true). On Implicit Flow, the `nonce` is required. `send_nonce` option is ignored.




### Client Config Options

These are the configuration options for the client_options hash of the configuration.

| Field                  | Description                                                     | Default    | Replaced by discovery? |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| identifier             | The OAuth2 client_id                                            |            |                        |
| secret                 | The OAuth2 client secret                                        |            |                        |
| redirect_uri           | The OAuth2 authorization callback url in your app               |            |                        |
| scheme                 | The http scheme to use                                          | https      |                        |
| host                   | The host of the authorization server                            | nil        |                        |
| port                   | The port for the authorization server                           | 443        |                        |
| authorization_endpoint | The authorize endpoint on the authorization server              | /authorize | yes                    |
| token_endpoint         | The token endpoint on the authorization server                  | /token     | yes                    |
| userinfo_endpoint      | The user info endpoint on the authorization server              | /userinfo  | yes                    |
| jwks_uri               | The jwks_uri on the authorization server                        | /jwk       | yes                    |
| end_session_endpoint   | The url to call to log the user out at the authorization server | nil        | yes                    |





  * Support for other client authentication methods. If don't specified
  `:client_auth_method` option, automatically set `:basic`.
  
  * Use "OpenID Connect Discovery", You should specify `true` to `discovery` option. (default false)
  * In "OpenID Connect Discovery", generally provider should have Webfinger endpoint.
  If provider does not have Webfinger endpoint, You can specify "Issuer" to option.
  e.g. `issuer: "https://myprovider.com"`
  It means to get configuration from "https://myprovider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration".
  * The uid is by default using the `sub` value from the `user_info` response,
  which in some applications is not the expected value. To avoid such limitations, the uid label can be
  configured by providing the omniauth `uid_field` option to a different label (i.e. `preferred_username`)
  that appears in the `user_info` details.
  * The `issuer` property should exactly match the provider's issuer link.
  * The `response_mode` option is optional and specifies how the result of the authorization request is formatted.
  * Some OpenID Connect providers require the `scope` attribute in requests to the token endpoint, even if
  this is not in the protocol specifications. In those cases, the `send_scope_to_token_endpoint`
  property can be used to add the attribute to the token request. Initial value is `true`, which means that the
  scope attribute is included by default.
